# MoviePlotGenerator
**MIDS W266 Spring 2020 Final Project**

In this project, our team takes a look at different techniques for text generation primarily focused on generating movie plots of a certain genre. We explore different techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Generative Pretrained Transformer-2 (GPT-2) with  a focus on Horror and Romance movie genres. For this project, we use Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) performance metrics to quantify our results.
