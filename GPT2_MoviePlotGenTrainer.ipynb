The story begins with the discovery of a young, blind, middle-aged father's secret diary during an estate sale. The son's father is a very close friend of one of Harry Murny's, who died. Harry and his wife's son, named James Murny, find a new home in New Hampshire's Plymouth Colony. One evening, they meet a new brother, Daniel Murny , who becomes their guide into life, to the delight of their sister's brother, whose husband has died suddenly. Daniel takes them to the town tavern where he serves ale and watches them in wonderment before disappearing. The next day, Daniel is arrested for his father's diary, and is sentenced to death by hanging. Daniel's daughter, Martha , is distraught at her son's death and takes him to the local hospital, where he is saved from the hanging. However, Daniel's father takes the news and takes them back to Maine. It turns out that the story was true, and in their new home, the people there are black, which causes them great grief and resentment. Daniel's father and mother are now living with both black and white families. Their lives have changed drastically. They have more food, their daily lives have much less of a struggle, but they are often unable to deal with what is happening in their houses, but still need their white family to help them deal with it. Many are arrested by police agents and executed in their basements. Daniel's father, John Murny  finds his old diary in his son's house, and sees his father dead from hangman's noose. But on the night that Daniel was to be hung, he's alive and a free man. He returns home to Martha and Daniel's sister, who finds his diary. While Daniel has his father's diary out the window, the authorities have planted the diary's message  on the property: They will take your father back to New Hampshire for hanging, so they can execute him. She runs to find him in a basement. He is arrested for his diary and goes off to the town for a last drink before he is hanged. However, when he arrives, he's nearly arrested.\"\n",

He had to realize he is in love with Emily, just like him, after all, because he has not heard from her. He had to get married first, otherwise his family would suffer. David does this by creating one of the most famous relationships of the 1950s - a relationship between Emily and David. Emily is also pregnant and soon will have a child, so that's why he would not want to marry Emily. While on vacation David meets Emily, though without a word they begin to see each other. Emily is very protective and protective is David. David's brother, Joe Miller, is her former boyfriend, and even tells her his secret name, \"\"Bryan\"\" for jealousy. David is worried, and asks Emily what the matter is. Emily's response is that he really loves her, and has never had this type of relationship with a woman before. Emily has her doubts about David's feelings. Emily tells David that she will be pregnant, and then tells him to tell Emily she loves him. In a moment of great emotion David is able to communicate that he loved Emily and will marry Emily before her death, but Emily is not able to comprehend it. Emily, meanwhile, has become jealous of her brother's love for Emily, and she is extremely concerned for him. Emily has heard David has lied to Emily about his relationship with her boyfriend, but still is unable to understand that he is in love with Emily. Emily, however, understands him, and says that she wants David to be her husband or else she will divorce him. Emily tells David that Emily doesn't have any hope of ever getting an abortion, but David replies by saying that he will marry whoever he likes, but that Emily needs to understand that Emily can't marry whoever she wants. Emily's brother, in desperation for something to say, tells Emily's brother who is in a hurry by yelling, and then to his shame breaks out, shouting for him to go to his parents and say that he loves her. David, who has been listening to Emily's brother argue and tell him that Emily does not love him, gives Emily a hug and kisses her, and Emily remembers that he loves her. He leaves Emily and begins to fall for her. The next day is when everyone would have gotten married, though this is not how David wanted it to be, because he had already met Emily, before the beginning of the film. Emily tells David that she has moved in with him, and David begins to regret that Emily left him. The film then takes a further turn into the 1960s, David is now married to Emily and the children are married. It is time for Emily to marry another man. Later, Emily is pregnant with David's third child. She asks Emily if she has heard or read about their plans for them.

In the scene the train car's conductor and conductor crew are shown playing in a big group at the top of a hill.

It is a film and his own first movie that he would set down his nose at any company in New York, but not all of his friends would let him. Some of them would see this movie, go to the bar, and be angry at them instead of at his friends. Then they would get on the train and they would fight with them and then they would tell the story. The movie is set in New York City and is made in the late 1950s. Gene Wilder's assistant, Gene Korn, is at the top of a mountain overlooking Manhattan on the edge of the city where he and Eddy Pender, Wilder's longtime secretary are about to work on the opening of production on Misfit Hunter.

It is the \"\"Sho-ha Da-ha\"\", the official name of the movie, the train that was built in 1951 under Wilder's direction and used as the opening movie scene. When the film was released Gene Wilder called in his assistant Gene Korn to look at his old movie. Gene Korn was able to make a movie, so his name appears in the credits. The film takes place in a theater at the time of Star War, the opening credits have no credits and Gene Pender, Wilder's longtime secretary, gives Gene the location of the original shooting location and gives him all of Meller's original scripts\n",

Suddenly, Al and Eddie run out to confront Al and Eddie. After the confrontation, Al and Eddie run through a gas station and a tunnel to Al's place. Al and Eddie fight Al and Eddie with a gun. Al and Eddie then arrive at Al's place. They get ready and Al drives them around Al's house, destroying many objects inside of Al's house including books and his car. Al and Eddie chase him through Al's house and they open fire on Al. They then drive off a ladder to the street of Al's apartment before finally going into Al's car. They are surrounded by vampires, but Al and Eddie fight the vampires. Al and Eddie get back in Al's car, after which the girls get out and go off. Al then escapes and begins a race with Eddie chasing Al.\n",

            "\"The film takes place in the year 18th Century during the reign of King Richard III in England and revolves around the rivalry of the three Princes of Orange, Richard, Richard's wife and her illegitimate son, Prince Charles of England. The story revolves around two brothers and two sisters: Richard III  and his son, Richard III's wife Margaret . The Princes are part of the king's entourage leading a private tour of his castle, where they are met by King Richard's entourage. There are flashbacks to Margaret and Richard's childhood on Cape Richard, during the Crusades when Richard's grandfather, Geoffrey of Monmouth  was the best of all the Crusaders, including Richard, Richard's great-uncle. King Richard sends his family on one of his numerous expeditions to the Holy Land during the Crusade. There are several memorable scenes between the two brothers, Richard and Richard III. During a battle between Richard III and his uncle, Geoffrey, Geoffrey is killed during the battle. During Richard III's funeral, Margaret is presented with a small golden ring and made to wear it ever since. The ring is given to her by Geoffrey's mother; she tells Richard that she has brought him to England. Richard II is crowned King of England on August 31, and Richard III the King of Prussia during the coronation. The film is also filled with humorous scenes and characters, each one in a different epoch from the others. The most notable example is the interaction of young Elizabeth, Richard's wife and Queen of England with the two brothers. Her father-in-law, Edward IV , was her brother.[6] The King of England uses the crown to make a claim to his brother-in-law's kingdom and claim his title as King of England. The princes and nobles are introduced as members of royal courtiers in the story. The prince of England tells his friend, Lord Palmerston, \"\"I am Richard III of Monmouth, my fellow citizens...I will crown you king and you can make me your king.\"[7] Monmouth is an obscure character, though it is implied that he is a fictitious character. This was done to keep Monmouth and Richard's rivalry fresh, although his role is largely relegated. The Princes are not mentioned at all during their coronation, although they are mentioned by all the other Princes. During the ceremony, all the Princes are announced to be in charge of the new Crown, with one exception: Queen Margaret. Monmouth is named as the minister of state, and the only person in the audience who is not informed that Monmouth is indeed the King of England is a clerk. Monmouth is sent out on a private mission to inform the government about the Holy Land and to convince the King of Prussia to allow him to be granted some influence over the political situation there, for no other purposes. When Monmouth reaches Constantinople, he is accompanied by a Persian general and a group of Turkish generals, led by the Persian general and his Turkish general brother Isas, who have also been hired. Monmouth, believing to be the true king, convinces the Turks that he is indeed the real king, and they send him to Monmouth's headquarters. Monmouth then informs Monmouth, by name, of his new position. Monmouth advises Monmouth to find out what he must do. Monmouth asks Monmouth to give an advance of 5000 marks, but Monmouth refuses citing personal reasons. Angered, Monmouth demands the money and he has Monmouth arrested, charged with tax evasion. On hearing this accusation, Monmouth makes his escape along with his friend Philip, a fellow member of the House of Orange, who tells Monmouth that Elizabeth will be his mistress. Monmouth is sentenced to death by the House of Orange. Richard III is crowned King of England, and his father and Prince Philip are made his heirs to the throne. The three Princes are then all invited to attend a banquet in celebration, while Richard the Lionheart  secretly attends a reception where he tells the Queen that he is the only heir of the throne. The scene is taken to indicate that the King is aware of Monmouth's involvement with the Princes of Orange, and the Royal family must now have complete control over him or else he will revolt. Monmouth, however, secretly decides to remain at the council to ensure that Richard is the King and not the traitor to the kingdom. Richard's uncle becomes despondent after Monmouth is discovered to have stolen the new crown and throne for himself. Monmouth then decides to return to England under a false identity, so that he can convince the House of Orange to allow Richard to be their king. This requires Monmouth to betray everyone and return before long with the royal seal, but Richard would most likely be killed without him. Mon\n",
